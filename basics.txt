HDL  = Hardware descripition language
FPGA = Field programmable gate array(reprogrammable)

Command Window is where the execution takes place
Editor is where we add files

.m= script file
.mdl/.slx= modeling file
.fig = figure file
.mat= binary variable

1 row then its's row vector
 double data type takes 8 byte initially
whos is used to get the size of row or column
 
equal no. of rows and columns = Square matrix
inv(a)
 = adj(a)\|a|
 Rank is no. of values in row
ctrl R to comment

random gives values between o and 1
magic gives a matrix of max value

numel gives no. of elements

length= no. of columns
size= no. of rows and columns
min= min of column
min(min)= most minimum value
max = max value
max(max()) =max value

Data types:
1)Primary Numeric, Boolean, Text, Function Handling
2)Secodary

Function Handling:

Ques:F(x)=equation of  astaraight line is given by y=mx=c. Compute y cordinates
ith a slope m=0.5 and c= -2 at the following x co ordinates
x=0,1.5,3,4,5,7,9,10

Create a vector t of 10 elements ie 1 to 10 & compute the value of x=tsint,y=(t-1)/(t+1)
y=sint(t^2)/t^2
