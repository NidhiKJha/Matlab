HDL  = Hardware descripition language
FPGA = Field programmable gate array(reprogrammable)

Command Window is where the execution takes place
Editor is where we add files

.m= script file
.mdl/.slx= modeling file
.fig = figure file
.mat= binary variable

1 row then its's row vector
 double data type takes 8 byte initially
whos is used to get the size of row or column
 
equal no. of rows and columns = Square matrix
inv(a)
 = adj(a)\|a|
 Rank is no. of values in row
ctrl R to comment

random gives values between o and 1
magic gives a matrix of max value

numel gives no. of elements

length= no. of columns
size= no. of rows and columns
min= min of column
min(min)= most minimum value
max = max value
max(max()) =max value

Data types:
1)Primary Numeric, Boolean, Text, Function Handling
2)Secodary

Function Handling:

Ques:F(x)=equation of  astaraight line is given by y=mx=c. Compute y cordinates
ith a slope m=0.5 and c= -2 at the following x co ordinates
x=0,1.5,3,4,5,7,9,10

Create a vector t of 10 elements ie 1 to 10 & compute the value of x=tsint,y=(t-1)/(t+1)
y=sint(t^2)/t^2

Q) x=rcosa,y=rsina lie on a circle x^2+y^2=r^2.Create column vector value a=o,pi\4pi\2,3pi\4, pi, 5pi/4. and r=2
Compute vector x&y. Also check r=sqrt[(x^2)+(y^2)]r

Secondary data type
* cell : Combination of diffrent data types
It is a generalisAtion of the basic array in matlab that can have as its elements any type of matlab data structures.

* Structure ; Everything comesin  an array only

ont is used to integrate
z=sin(x+y)
let int(z,x,0,pi/2)

Q) Define a column vector v=[x y]'
inner product= v'.v
outer product=v.v'
TO CHange from conjugate to real we add the term real

/*disp can be replaced with msgbox */

legend tells about the difference between two graphs plotted between same co ordinates

hold on stops the display time
hold off displays all the results or plotsS

linestyle is how you draw the line
marker is also a line but it has a mark on it

line(t,y2, "line style", "--")
line(t,y3, "marker", "00" )

legend enables the writing on graph

To fill the empty or blank araea we use fill command

bar command is used to represent in bar style
pie command is used to get a pie chart

if we have to plot two curves on same axis the we use the command plotyy()

get function is to take the handle and set function is used to set it.

hist() is used to get the maximum frequency

stem for non continuous function
