HDL  = Hardware descripition language
FPGA = Field programmable gate array(reprogrammable)

Command Window is where the execution takes place
Editor is where we add files

.m= script file
.mdl/.slx= modeling file
.fig = figure file
.mat= binary variable

1 row then its's row vector
 double data type takes 8 byte initially
whos is used to get the size of row or column
 
equal no. of rows and columns = Square matrix
inv(a)
 = adj(a)\|a|
 Rank is no. of values in row
ctrl R to comment

random gives values between o and 1
magic gives a matrix of max value

numel gives no. of elements

length= no. of columns
size= no. of rows and columns
min= min of column
min(min)= most minimum value
max = max value
max(max()) =max value

Data types:
1)Primary Numeric, Boolean, Text, Function Handling
2)Secodary

Function Handling:

Ques:F(x)=equation of  astaraight line is given by y=mx=c. Compute y cordinates
ith a slope m=0.5 and c= -2 at the following x co ordinates
x=0,1.5,3,4,5,7,9,10

Create a vector t of 10 elements ie 1 to 10 & compute the value of x=tsint,y=(t-1)/(t+1)
y=sint(t^2)/t^2

Q) x=rcosa,y=rsina lie on a circle x^2+y^2=r^2.Create column vector value a=o,pi\4pi\2,3pi\4, pi, 5pi/4. and r=2
Compute vector x&y. Also check r=sqrt[(x^2)+(y^2)]r

Secondary data type
* cell : Combination of diffrent data types
It is a generalisAtion of the basic array in matlab that can have as its elements any type of matlab data structures.

* Structure ; Everything comesin  an array only

ont is used to integrate
z=sin(x+y)
let int(z,x,0,pi/2)

Q) Define a column vector v=[x y]'
inner product= v'.v
outer product=v.v'
TO CHange from conjugate to real we add the term real

/*disp can be replaced with msgbox */
